This program simulates the game known as 'Battleship'.
The input file determines the coordinates of the ships
and the player takes shots at the 10x10 board with coordinates
labeled XY, X in the range A-J and Y in 0-9.

The game ends either by the user entering 'q'/'Q' or
once all boats have been sunk.
